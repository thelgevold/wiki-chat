            "General Taylor's victory at Buena Vista, February 22d, 23d, and 24th,\n1847, with an army composed almost entirely of volunteers who had not\nbeen in battle before, and over a vastly superior force numerically,\nmade his nomination for the Presidency by the Whigs a foregone\nconclusion.  He was nominated and elected in 1848.  I believe that he\nsincerely regretted this turn in his fortunes, preferring the peace\nafforded by a quiet life free from abuse to the honor of filling the\nhighest office in the gift of any people, the Presidency of the United\nStates.",
            "The surprise of the enemy was complete, the victory overwhelming; some\nthree thousand prisoners fell into Scott's hands, also a large amount of\nordnance and ordnance stores.  The prisoners were paroled, the artillery\nparked and the small arms and ammunition destroyed.  The battle of Buena\nVista was probably very important to the success of General Scott at\nCerro Gordo and in his entire campaign from Vera Cruz to the great\nplains reaching to the City of Mexico.  The only army Santa Anna had to\nprotect his capital and the mountain passes west of Vera Cruz, was the\none he had with him confronting General Taylor. It is not likely that he\nwould have gone as far north as Monterey to attack the United States\ntroops when he knew his country was threatened with invasion further\nsouth.  When Taylor moved to Saltillo and then advanced on to Buena\nVista, Santa Anna crossed the desert confronting the invading army,\nhoping no doubt to crush it and get back in time to meet General Scott\nin the mountain passes west of Vera Cruz.  His attack on Taylor was\ndisastrous to the Mexican army, but, notwithstanding this, he marched\nhis army to Cerro Gordo, a distance not much short of one thousand miles\nby the line he had to travel, in time to intrench himself well before\nScott got there.  If he had been successful at Buena Vista his troops\nwould no doubt have made a more stubborn resistance at Cerro Gordo.  Had\nthe battle of Buena Vista not been fought Santa Anna would have had time\nto move leisurely to meet the invader further south and with an army not\ndemoralized nor depleted by defeat.",
            "While General Taylor was away with the bulk of his army, the little\ngarrison up the river was besieged.  As we lay in our tents upon the\nsea-shore, the artillery at the fort on the Rio Grande could be\ndistinctly heard.",
            "At the break of day on the 9th, the army under Taylor was ready to renew\nthe battle; but an advance showed that the enemy had entirely left our\nfront during the night.  The chaparral before us was impenetrable except\nwhere there were roads or trails, with occasionally clear or bare spots\nof small dimensions.  A body of men penetrating it might easily be\nambushed.  It was better to have a few men caught in this way than the\nwhole army, yet it was necessary that the garrison at the river should\nbe relieved.  To get to them the chaparral had to be passed.  Thus I\nassume General Taylor reasoned.  He halted the army not far in advance\nof the ground occupied by the Mexicans the day before, and selected\nCaptain C. F. Smith, of the artillery, and Captain McCall, of my\ncompany, to take one hundred and fifty picked men each and find where\nthe enemy had gone.  This left me in command of the company, an honor\nand responsibility I thought very great.",
            "General Taylor was himself only a colonel, in real rank, at that time,\nand a brigadier-general by brevet.  He was assigned to duty, however, by\nthe President, with the rank which his brevet gave him.  Worth was not\nso assigned, but by virtue of commanding a division he must, under the\narmy regulations of that day, have drawn the pay of his brevet rank.\nThe question was submitted to Washington, and no response was received\nuntil after the army had reached the Rio Grande.  It was decided against\nGeneral Worth, who at once tendered his resignation and left the army,\ngoing north, no doubt, by the same vessel that carried it.  This kept\nhim out of the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma.  Either the\nresignation was not accepted, or General Worth withdrew it before action\nhad been taken.  At all events he returned to the army in time to\ncommand his division in the battle of Monterey, and served with it to\nthe end of the war.",
            "General Taylor's force was about six thousand five hundred strong, in\nthree divisions, under Generals Butler, Twiggs and Worth.  The troops\nwent into camp at Walnut Springs, while the engineer officers, under\nMajor Mansfield--a General in the late war--commenced their\nreconnoissance.  Major Mansfield found that it would be practicable to\nget troops around, out of range of the Black Fort and the works on the\ndetached hills to the north-west of the city, to the Saltillo road.\nWith this road in our possession, the enemy would be cut off from\nreceiving further supplies, if not from all communication with the\ninterior. General Worth, with his division somewhat reinforced, was\ngiven the task of gaining possession of the Saltillo road, and of\ncarrying the detached works outside the city, in that quarter. He\nstarted on his march early in the afternoon of the 20th.  The divisions\nunder Generals Butler and Twiggs were drawn up to threaten the east and\nnorth sides of the city and the works on those fronts, in support of the\nmovement under General Worth. Worth's was regarded as the main attack on\nMonterey, and all other operations were in support of it.  His march\nthis day was uninterrupted; but the enemy was seen to reinforce heavily\nabout the Bishop's Palace and the other outside fortifications on their\nleft.  General Worth reached a defensible position just out of range of\nthe enemy's guns on the heights north-west of the city, and bivouacked\nfor the night.  The engineer officers with him--Captain Sanders and\nLieutenant George G. Meade, afterwards the commander of the victorious\nNational army at the battle of Gettysburg--made a reconnoissance to the\nSaltillo road under cover of night.",
            "Early in the forenoon of the 8th of May as Palo Alto was approached, an\narmy, certainly outnumbering our little force, was seen, drawn up in\nline of battle just in front of the timber.  Their bayonets and\nspearheads glistened in the sunlight formidably.  The force was composed\nlargely of cavalry armed with lances.  Where we were the grass was tall,\nreaching nearly to the shoulders of the men, very stiff, and each stock\nwas pointed at the top, and hard and almost as sharp as a\ndarning-needle. General Taylor halted his army before the head of column\ncame in range of the artillery of the Mexicans.  He then formed a line\nof battle, facing the enemy.  His artillery, two batteries and two\neighteen-pounder iron guns, drawn by oxen, were placed in position at\nintervals along the line.  A battalion was thrown to the rear, commanded\nby Lieutenant-Colonel Childs, of the artillery, as reserves.  These\npreparations completed, orders were given for a platoon of each company\nto stack arms and go to a stream off to the right of the command, to\nfill their canteens and also those of the rest of their respective\ncompanies.  When the men were all back in their places in line, the\ncommand to advance was given.  As I looked down that long line of about\nthree thousand armed men, advancing towards a larger force also armed,\nI thought what a fearful responsibility General Taylor must feel,\ncommanding such a host and so far away from friends.  The Mexicans\nimmediately opened fire upon us, first with artillery and then with\ninfantry.  At first their shots did not reach us, and the advance was\ncontinued.  As we got nearer, the cannon balls commenced going through\nthe ranks.  They hurt no one, however, during this advance, because they\nwould strike the ground long before they reached our line, and\nricochetted through the tall grass so slowly that the men would see them\nand open ranks and let them pass.  When we got to a point where the\nartillery could be used with effect, a halt was called, and the battle\nopened on both sides.",
            "General Taylor was opposed to anything like plundering by the troops,\nand in this instance, I doubt not, he looked upon the enemy as the\naggrieved party and was not willing to injure them further than his\ninstructions from Washington demanded.  His orders to the troops\nenjoined scrupulous regard for the rights of all peaceable persons and\nthe payment of the highest price for all supplies taken for the use of\nthe army.",
            "General Scott had opposed conquest by the way of the Rio Grande,\nMatamoras and Saltillo from the first.  Now that he was in command of\nall the forces in Mexico, he withdrew from Taylor most of his regular\ntroops and left him only enough volunteers, as he thought, to hold the\nline then in possession of the invading army.  Indeed Scott did not deem\nit important to hold anything beyond the Rio Grande, and authorized\nTaylor to fall back to that line if he chose.  General Taylor protested\nagainst the depletion of his army, and his subsequent movement upon\nBuena Vista would indicate that he did not share the views of his chief\nin regard to the unimportance of conquest beyond the Rio Grande.",
            "Reinforcements having arrived, in the month of August the movement\ncommenced from Matamoras to Camargo, the head of navigation on the Rio\nGrande.  The line of the Rio Grande was all that was necessary to hold,\nunless it was intended to invade Mexico from the North.  In that case\nthe most natural route to take was the one which General Taylor\nselected.  It entered a pass in the Sierra Madre Mountains, at Monterey,\nthrough which the main road runs to the City of Mexico.  Monterey itself\nwas a good point to hold, even if the line of the Rio Grande covered all\nthe territory we desired to occupy at that time.  It is built on a plain\ntwo thousand feet above tide water, where the air is bracing and the\nsituation healthy."
